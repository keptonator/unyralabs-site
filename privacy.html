  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Product:</strong> EyeScan Pro — OCR & PDF Scanner<br/>
  <strong>Provider:</strong> Unyra Labs (“we”, “us”)<br/>
  <strong>Effective date:</strong> 15 January 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how EyeScan Pro processes information when you use our app and services.</p>

  <h2>1) Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your documents are processed on your device for scanning/OCR. We do not require you to create an account.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data.</li>
    <li>Some data may be handled by Apple (payments/subscriptions) and by system services you choose to use (e.g., iCloud).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Information you provide</h2>
  <p><strong>Documents and images you scan/import:</strong> The app processes photos, scans, PDFs, and text you choose to import or create.</p>
  <p><strong>Support requests:</strong> If you email us, we receive your email address and the content you send (and any attachments you include).</p>

  <h2>3) How the app processes your documents</h2>
  <p>EyeScan Pro performs scanning, enhancement, and OCR to let you view, search, export, and manage your files.</p>
  <p><strong>On-device processing:</strong> OCR and document processing are designed to run on your device. We do not require uploading your documents to our servers to use core features.</p>
  <p><strong>Sharing/export:</strong> When you export or share a file, it is sent to the destination you choose (e.g., Files, Mail, third-party apps) under that destination’s privacy practices.</p>

  <h2>4) Data storage</h2>
  <p><strong>Local storage:</strong> Files you create are stored locally on your device.</p>
  <p><strong>iCloud (optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud / iCloud Drive for the app (via iOS settings or your device configuration), Apple may sync your files across your devices. Apple’s handling of iCloud data is governed by Apple’s policies.</p>

  <h2>5) Purchases and subscriptions</h2>
  <p>If you purchase a subscription or lifetime access, payments are processed by Apple via In-App Purchases. We do not receive your full payment details (such as your credit card number). Apple may provide us with limited information such as transaction identifiers and subscription status to validate access.</p>

  <h2>6) Analytics, tracking, and advertising</h2>
  <p><strong>No ad tracking:</strong> We do not use the app to track you across other companies’ apps and websites for advertising.</p>
  <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We aim to minimize analytics. If we use privacy-friendly diagnostic data (e.g., crash reports) to improve stability, it may include device and app performance information. This data is used to maintain and improve the app.</p>

  <h2>7) Contacts and other permissions</h2>
  <p>If the app offers optional features (for example, saving a business card as a contact), iOS will ask for permission at the time you use the feature. You can change permissions at any time in iOS Settings.</p>

  <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
  <p>Files you create remain on your device (and optionally in iCloud if enabled) until you delete them. Support emails are retained as long as needed to respond and for reasonable record-keeping.</p>

  <h2>9) Your choices and rights</h2>
  <p>You can delete your documents within the app and remove the app to delete local app data. If you use iCloud, you can manage iCloud-stored files in Apple’s Files/iCloud settings.</p>
  <p>Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK), you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing. To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@unyralabs.com">support@unyralabs.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>10) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the effective date.</p>

  <p class="meta">Note: This policy describes EyeScan Pro’s processing as implemented. If functionality changes (e.g., cloud OCR, third-party analytics), this policy must be updated accordingly.</p>
